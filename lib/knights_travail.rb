#Assignment
#Your task is to build a function knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

#You can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates. Your function would therefore look like:

#knight_moves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]
#knight_moves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]
#knight_moves([3,3],[0,0]) == [[3,3],[1,2],[0,0]]
#Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
#Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.
#Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
#Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:
#> knight_moves([3,3],[4,3])
# => You made it in 3 moves!  Heres your path:
#   [3,3]
#  [4,5]
# [2,4]
#[4,3]

			if coord[0]+x[0] < 9 && coord[0]+x[0] > 0 && coord[1]+x[1] < 9 && coord[1]+x[1] > 0
